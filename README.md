# Parcel Tracking - Core

This is a clean architecture-based domain area that searches delivery information by scraping from the courier company using the invoice number. It is used as a submodule in services (clients, servers, etc.) that use the domain.

We don't modify the code directly in this repository; we develop, build, and push it from the [`core-dev`](https://github.com/parcel-tracking/core-dev) repository.
